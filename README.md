# NXTPrinterControllerAndroid
We made a Printer by LEGO WINDSTORMS NXT. And we want that user use the android mobile device to input their word and image to print. This application uses Bluetooth to control the NXT without NXT programs by using NXT Bluetooth Direct Command.
<br/>
The following image is a NXTPrinter Example:! [NXTPrinter](http://ts4.mm.bing.net/th?id=JN.7SEzqm3FD6F%2bFAdX%2fZ834A&pid=15.1)
<br/>
And you can use our Application to control our NXTPrinter or the NXTPrinter which is similar of ours.
